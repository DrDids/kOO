R package: kOO project

- start of the project 24/05/2012 -

The R package to be built aims at implementing what I did in a few scripts 
for the preparation of the papers I published in CaGEO and TGIS (see below).
Basically this is related to the computation of the distribution of k co-occurrences of spatial events 
(generalising the contiguity distributions - 2 co-occurrences at distance 0) to derive 
spatial clustering statistics (mainly using the Shannon entropy, then called the k-spatial entropy) 
and methods linked to this: SOOk, SelSOOk (see caGEO paper) and scankOO (see TGIS).
Another method (CAkOO) performing a k-Correspondence Analysis (i.e. on a multiway table with k entries) on 
the contingencies of co-occurrenceshas been already "published in my JSS paper about another R package: PTAk.

- At the moment the basic scripts I have are based on points and use the R package spatstat, but I would like also 
to extend to any geometry type.

- keywords: spatial point pattern, spatial pattern, geometric objects, co-occurrences, k-spatial entropy, 
Ripley's K, regression tree, conditional entropy, spatial clustering, scan statistis, GAM, ...

Interested to collaborate on this?
